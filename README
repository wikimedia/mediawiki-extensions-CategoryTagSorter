CategoryTagSorter - alphabetizes category links at the bottom of an article


== Description ==

A MediaWiki article typically displays the list of category links in the order in which
they appear in the article. For articles with many categories, it can be difficult for
readers to find the category they're looking for. This extension simply alphabetizes those
category links. The sorting is ascii-betical, which usually works out OK as most wikis are
configured to have the first letter of a title be uppercase (see $wgCapitalLinks.)

This extension adds a user preference for those users who prefer MediaWiki's default
behavior (and who enjoy searching aimlessly through lists of categories).


== Installation ==

Install this extension like any other extension, by adding a line in LocalSettings.php
like this:

 wfLoadExtension( 'CategoryTagSorter' );
